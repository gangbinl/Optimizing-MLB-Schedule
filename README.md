# Optimizing-MLB-Schedule
Created a schedule optimizer for the MLB, since the MLB does not take into account the strength of schedule when forming the next season’s schedule.
Minimized the differences between each teams’ strength of schedule and the average strength of schedule.
Optimized home and away games according to the objective goal.
Provided a visual graph to show the modeling results.
Used Julia and Jupyter Notebook.
